    <!-- 
      The apple-touch-icon.png file is used for creating a custom icon that appears when users bookmark a website or add it to their home screen on an iOS device, such as an iPhone or iPad. This icon is specifically used for Apple's mobile devices and provides a visual representation of the website or web app.
      
      When a user bookmarks a site on an iOS device or adds a web app to their home screen, Safari looks for the apple-touch-icon.png file in the root directory of the website. If it finds the file, it uses the image as the icon for the bookmark or home screen shortcut.
      
      The recommended size for the apple-touch-icon.png file is 180x180 pixels for high-resolution displays. Including this icon enhances the user experience by providing a recognizable and visually appealing representation of the website or web app on the user's home screen. -->

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
